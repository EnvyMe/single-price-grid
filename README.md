## My process

Just a simple project using Bootstrap 5 grid system to create a responsive price card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned

Reinforced knowledge of using margins and padding to properly position divs and the text within them. Used media query to change padding at appropriate screen size.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 1000px) {
    body .main-window{
        padding: 8% 30%;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

None at the moment.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap 5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - An important resource for working with Bootstraps grid system.
